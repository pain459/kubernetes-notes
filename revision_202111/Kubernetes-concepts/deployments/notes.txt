Experiment:

1. What happens if we delete the pod?

New one is created.

(base) ➜  deployments git:(main) ✗ kubectl delete pod nginx-deployment-b959b554d-7wjnf
pod "nginx-deployment-b959b554d-7wjnf" deleted
(base) ➜  deployments git:(main) ✗ kubectl get pods

2. what happens if you delete the replicaset?

Replicaset will become empty and containers will be recreated. Replicaset name is observed unchanged.

3. Updating the deployment

Updated the replicas to 3 for demo purposes.

(base) ➜  deployments git:(main) ✗ kubectl apply -f nginx_deployment_exp1.yaml 
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment configured
(base) ➜  deployments git:(main) ✗ kubectl get pods
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-deployment-b959b554d-87swd   1/1     Running   0          3m34s

(base) ➜  deployments git:(main) ✗ 

4. Try rolling updates by updating the image.

Updated replicas to 10 and updated image id

(base) ➜  deployments git:(main) ✗ kubectl apply -f nginx_deployment_exp1.yaml
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment configured
(base) ➜  deployments git:(main) ✗ kubectl get pods

5. Inducing faulty image name and update the deployment.

Updated image tag to some number greater than current version of nginx 100.25 and applied the config.

(base) ➜  deployments git:(main) ✗ kubectl get pods
NAME                                READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE

nginx-deployment-697fc66b4b-9nbfq   1/1     Running            0          12m
nginx-deployment-697fc66b4b-wspfq   1/1     Running            0          12m
nginx-deployment-697fc66b4b-z2bwq   1/1     Running            0          12m
nginx-deployment-697fc66b4b-zzhr2   1/1     Running            0          12m
(base) ➜  deployments git:(main) ✗ 

We can observe that atleast 9 containers are running and rest of the containers are trying to boot up with the new image, ofcourse failing.

current replicaset is looking like this 

(base) ➜  deployments git:(main) ✗ kubectl get replicasets
NAME                          DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
nginx-deployment-68f9c8df46   5         5         0       8m57s
nginx-deployment-697fc66b4b   8         8         8       14m
nginx-deployment-b959b554d    0         0         0       24m
(base) ➜  deployments git:(main) ✗ 

We can also observe the deployment status as below.

(base) ➜  deployments git:(main) ✗ kubectl get deployment
NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment   8/10    5            8           30m

6. correct the version at deployment and then observe the output

Updated the tags to nginx:latest and re-applied the file. For every time we apply one replicaset is getting created.

(base) ➜  deployments git:(main) ✗ kubectl get pods
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

yes, we can but k8s will recreate the containers. replica age will be changed.
